# Objectives 
The main reason for this project was to introduce myself to gRPC communication between Server and Client , this is useful while communicating between Microservices. Below are the specific things i learned during this project
- Writing `protobuf` files 
- Managing the code generated by multiple protobuf files 
```bash
protoc --proto_path=proto   --go_out=grpcPkg/calc --go_opt=paths=source_relative   --go-grpc_out=grpcPkg/calc  --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative   proto/calc.proto
protoc --proto_path=proto   --go_out=grpcPkg/crud --go_opt=paths=source_relative   --go-grpc_out=grpcPkg/crud  --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative   proto/crud.proto
```
- Writing gRPC servers /clients with multiple Service form different `protobuf` files
- gRPC Server/Clients that can perform CRUD operations with different Request and Response Types with Error Handling 
- These clients are then connected to SQLite for Database changes 
- gRPC Server/ Clients that can stream data

I was a fun project ðŸ˜„
